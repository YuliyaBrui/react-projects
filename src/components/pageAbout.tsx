    <h2>How do I search for information?</h2>
    <span>
      When it comes to searching for information, a little bit of planning and
      consideration go a long way and may save you time (and frustration) in the
      long run.

      <h3>Examine your question</h3>
      <p>
        Before you begin looking for information, you need to understand what
        you are looking for. Take time to understand your research topic, or
        assignment question and give some thought to what you want to know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where are the gaps in your knowledge?</li>
        <li>
          What information do you need to find to support your arguments?{' '}
        </li>
        <li>What depth of information do you need? </li>
        <li>
          Does the information you need cover a particular time period, or
          geographical region?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Identify keywords</h3>
      <p>
        Keywords are words and phrases used to describe the main concepts,
        ideas, events and issues you are researching. Keywords allow you to
        focus your search using targeted words to get the best results from
        academic search tools. Therefore, before you even begin searching for
        information, it is important that you spend some time defining the topic
        you are researching in terms of keywords.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to perform a thorough search, it is also important that you
        consider alternative words and phrases (synonyms) which may also be used
        to describe the concepts you are researching. If your initial search is
        not successful, having a good list of alternative keywords prepared will
        save you time and frustration.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h3>Set Limits</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have a list of keywords, you need to consider what limits
        may apply to your search. For example, you may want to limit your search
        to information from a particular time frame, geographical region, or to
        a particular field of study (or subject area). To some extent this may
        be dictated by your question, or the way in which you have chosen to
        narrow the focus of your research.You may also want to limit your search
        to a particular type of information, or type of publication.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        It is worth noting that if you are looking for very specialist
        information, such as a marketing report, or a particular set of data for
        example, it may be that you will need to use a specialist information
        resource (or database) for this.
